# Discussion Topics for VMware Security Assessment

## Assessment Methodology

**Q: Baseline security standards**
What security frameworks do you use as baseline for VMware assessments? Currently using CIS benchmarks but considering NIST or DISA STIG.

**Q: Assessment frequency**
How often do you run comprehensive security assessments? Monthly, quarterly, or event-driven? Looking for industry best practices.

## Tool Integration

**Q: SIEM integration**
Anyone integrating assessment results with SIEM platforms? Need to feed security findings into Splunk for centralized monitoring.

**Q: Vulnerability scanners**
How does this tool compare with Nessus or Qualys for VMware-specific security checks? Looking for coverage comparison.

## Compliance & Reporting

**Q: SOC 2 compliance**
Using this for SOC 2 Type II audits. What additional controls and evidence collection do you recommend for compliance reporting?

**Q: Executive reporting**
Need to present security posture to C-level executives. Any templates or visualization approaches that work well for non-technical audiences?

## Remediation Strategies

**Q: Prioritization framework**
With hundreds of findings, how do you prioritize remediation efforts? Risk-based approach or compliance-driven?

**Q: Automated remediation**
Anyone building automated remediation workflows based on assessment findings? Interested in PowerCLI or Ansible integration examples.

## Environment-Specific Challenges

**Q: Multi-tenant environments**
Running assessments in multi-tenant vSphere environments. How do you handle tenant isolation and reporting separation?

**Q: Air-gapped networks**
Challenges with security assessments in disconnected environments. What's your approach for offline scanning and reporting?

## Performance & Scale

**Q: Large environment optimization**
Assessing 1000+ VMs across multiple vCenters. Any performance tuning recommendations to minimize impact on production?

**Q: Scheduling strategies**
What's your approach for scheduling assessments to minimize business impact? Maintenance windows vs continuous monitoring?

## Custom Checks

**Q: Industry-specific requirements**
Healthcare environment with HIPAA requirements. Anyone developed custom security checks for healthcare compliance?

**Q: Third-party integrations**
Need to assess security of third-party applications running on VMware. How do you extend the tool for application-specific checks?
